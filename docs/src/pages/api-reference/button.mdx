# Button API

The Button API is used to create buttons that can be attached to messages. There are three types of buttons: CallButton,
PostbackButton, and UrlButton. Each button type has a constructor that takes a title and a payload. The payload is the
value that will be sent to your webhook when a user clicks the button. The payload is optional for UrlButton.

## CallButton

The CallButton is used to create a button that will initiate a phone call when clicked. The payload is the phone number
that will be called.

### Usage

```js copy
const { CallButton } = require('chat-bridge')

const button = new CallButton('Call Me', '+15555555555')
```

## PostbackButton

The PostbackButton is used to create a button that will send a postback event to your webhook when clicked. The payload
is the value that will be sent to your webhook.

### Usage

```js copy
const { PostbackButton } = require('chat-bridge')

const button = new PostbackButton('Click Me', 'postback_value')
```

## UrlButton

The UrlButton is used to create a button that will open a URL when clicked. The payload is the URL that will be opened.

### Usage

```js copy
const { UrlButton } = require('chat-bridge')

const button = new UrlButton('Click Me', 'https://www.google.com')
```
