# Getting Started with Chat Bridge

Follow these simple steps to create a bot that echoes back what you send it.

## Create a Facebook App and Page

To use Chat Bridge, you need to create a [Facebook App](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and
[Page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create). The Facebook App is the container for your bot, and the Page is the
identity that your bot assumes when talking to users.

<Steps>
### Step 1: Install Chat Bridge

To integrate Facebook Messenger webhook handling into your Node.js applications, install Chat Bridge using the following
command in your terminal:

```sh npm2yarn filename="Terminal" copy
npm i chat-bridge
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Chat Bridge uses environment variables to configure your bot. Create a new file named `.env` and add the following:

```sh filename=".env" copy
ACCESS_TOKEN = YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
VERIFY_TOKEN = YOUR_VERIFY_TOKEN
```

-   `ACCESS_TOKEN` is your Facebook Page's access token (found in your App Dashboard under the "Messenger" tab).
-   `VERIFY_TOKEN` is any string of your choosing, used to verify the webhook's authenticity.

### Step 3: Create a Bot

Create a new file named `index.js` and add the following code:

```js filename="index.js" copy
// Import the Client class
const { Client } = require('chat-bridge')

// Create a new Client instance
const client = new Client({
    accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
    verifyToken: 'YOUR_VERIFY_TOKEN',
})

// Listen for 'message' events
client.on('message', (event) => {
    const { sender, message } = event

    // Send a text message back to the user
    client.sendTextMessage(sender.id, `You wrote: ${message.text}`)
})

// Start the bot
client.start(() => {
    console.log('Bot is running')
})
```

### Step 4: Start the Bot

Run the following command to start your bot:

```sh filename="Terminal" copy
# Start the Bot
node index.js # or whatever you named your file
```

</Steps>

Visit [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080/) to test that the bot is running. If everything is working, you
should see the message "Bot is running."
