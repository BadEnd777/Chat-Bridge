# Getting Started

To start using Chat Bridge, follow these simple steps to create a bot that echoes back what you send it.

## Setup Chat Bridge

To use Chat Bridge, you need to create a [Facebook App](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and [Page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create). The Facebook App is the container for your bot, and the Page is the identity that your bot assumes when talking to users.

### Install Chat Bridge

Chat Bridge an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chat-bridge) that simplifies the integration of Facebook Messenger webhook handling into your Node.js applications. It offers a convenient way to interact with the Messenger Platform, handling incoming messages, postbacks, quick replies, and more.

```sh filename="Terminal" copy
npm install chat-bridge
```

This will install Chat Bridge and add it to your `package.json` file.

### Configure Environment Variables

Chat Bridge uses environment variables to configure your bot. Create a new file named `.env` and add the following:

```sh filename=".env" copy
ACCESS_TOKEN = YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
VERIFY_TOKEN = YOUR_VERIFY_TOKEN
```

- `ACCESS_TOKEN` is your Facebook Page's access token. You can find this in your App Dashboard under the "Messenger" tab.
- `VERIFY_TOKEN` is any string of your choosing. This is used to verify that the webhook is authentic and not being called by someone else.

### Create a Bot

Create a new file named `idnex.js` and add the following:

```js filename="index.js" copy
const { Client } = require('chat-bridge')

const client = new Client({
  accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
  verifyToken: 'YOUR_VERIFY_TOKEN',
})

client.on('message', event => {
  const { sender, message } = event

  client.sendTextMessage(sender.id, `You wrote: ${message.text}`)
})

client.start(() => {
  console.log('Bot is running')
})
```

This creates a new `Client` instance and listens for `message` events. When a message is received, it sends a text message back to the user.

### Start the Bot

Start your bot by running the following command:

```sh filename="Terminal" copy
node index.js # or whatever you named your file
```

This will start a server listening on port `8080`. You can test that the bot is running by visiting [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080/). If everything is working, you should see the message "Bot is running".
